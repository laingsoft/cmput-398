1)
	There is one floating point operation per item in each array. So for an array of size 16, there are 16 floating point operations
2)
	There are three global memory reads. One for out, and one for each in1 and in2. 
3)
	In the kernel, there is one global memory write per instance of the kernel. 
4)
	There are 2*inputlength*sizeof(float) bytes copied to the device, because you are required to upload the two input arrays. 
	The third, output array is simply allocated, and not transferred to the device. 
5)
	Only inputlength*sizeof(float) is transferred from the device to host. This is because there is no operations taking place 
	on the input arrays, and they are not changed.

1) BinarySearch is called one time for each element of each input array. The
algorithm runs concurrently on all of the items in the array at once, so it 
finds the position of each value concurrently. 
2) No, BinarySearch only works on sorted arrays, as one of the assumptions 
that is made is that you can assume that is A[J] is less than A[M], then all items
> A[M] are >A[J]
3) The best runtime of the merge algorthm run on the CPU is n*log(n), where 
N = length of the list. This is because the CPU can not (assuming not using threads)
run each search concurrently, so each element in A needs to be checked with a log(n) binary
search function.
4) Mergesort
5) Yes, Currently elements from A are inserted first, and elements from B are inserted after
checking for alignment errors. In order to correct for this, you would have to check each list dynamically.
